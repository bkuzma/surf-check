## Introduction

Surf Check started as a surf forecasting app for the JÃ¦ren area of Norway. I found myself constantly checking multiple sources for my surf forecast, namely one site for swell information and another for wind, and I thought it'd be great to consolidate the two data sources in one place.

Later on, after rereading some of William Finnegan's [writings](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/08/24/playing-docs-games-part-one) about Mark "Doc" Renneker, a San Francisco-based surfer who kept a meticuous journal of surf conditions every single time he went surfing, I thought it'd be great to add a journaling feature to the app.

This project also gave me an excuse to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and [serverless technologies](https://css-tricks.com/serverless/), among others.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

This project is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
